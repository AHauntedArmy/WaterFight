# Overview:
WaterFight is a mod for gorilla tag that indoruces a new gamemode based on times as a kid running during summer, battling each other with water guns, hoses, and, waterballoons. the water gun also acts as a cosmetic holdable in the rest of the game.

# Guide:
## The gun is used to visually indicated various player state information.
- black body colour means you're on a hit cooldown of 1 second, you can still fire water during the cooldown but not deal damage
- pump location tells you how much water pressure you have
- water tank colour tells you your health, it transitions from blue to red, blue being full health, red being dead.

## there are other dynamic modifers as well
- water settings are based on how many people are in the room, less people in the room means higher max water pressure.
- when someone hits you, you take 2% of their current synced water pressure, this still works while on hit cooldown.
- dead ice gorilla's deal less damage then live gorilla's.
